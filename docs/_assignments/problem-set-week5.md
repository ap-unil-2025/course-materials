# Problem Set 5: AI and Intelligent Agents

This problem set explores AI integration, prompt engineering, and building autonomous agents.

## Exercise 1: AI Dating App Assistant ðŸ’˜
Create `cupid_ai.py` to help people with dating profiles:

```python
def roast_my_profile(profile_text):
    """
    Generate a prompt for AI to humorously roast a dating profile
    Should be funny but not mean - think friendly comedian
    """
    
def create_pickup_line(interests, vibe='nerdy'):
    """
    Generate context-aware pickup lines
    Vibes: 'nerdy', 'smooth', 'dad_joke', 'cringe_on_purpose'
    """
    
def red_flag_detector(conversation):
    """
    Analyze chat for red flags:
    - Love bombing
    - Asking for money
    - Won't video chat
    - 'My ex was crazy'
    - Lives with 47 cats
    """
    
def bio_glow_up(boring_bio):
    """
    Transform boring bio into interesting one
    'I like travel and food' -> Something actually unique
    """
```

Test with: "Looking for my partner in crime. Love to laugh. Fluent in sarcasm."

## Exercise 2: Response Parser
Build a system to parse structured responses from AI:

```python
import json
import re

def parse_json_response(response):
    """
    Extract JSON from AI response, handling markdown code blocks
    Return parsed Python object or None if invalid
    """
    
def parse_list_response(response):
    """
    Extract numbered or bulleted lists from response
    Return list of items (strings)
    """
    
def parse_code_blocks(response, language=None):
    """
    Extract code blocks from response
    If language specified, only return blocks of that language
    Return list of (language, code) tuples
    """
    
def parse_structured_data(response, schema):
    """
    Parse response according to a schema
    Schema example: {
        'name': str,
        'age': int,
        'skills': list,
        'active': bool
    }
    """
```

## Exercise 3: Meme Generator Pipeline ðŸ¤£
Create an AI chain for viral meme creation:

```python
class MemeFactory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.meme_history = []
        self.viral_score = 0
    
    def analyze_trend(self, current_events):
        """Find memeable moments in news/events"""
        
    def generate_template(self, concept):
        """Pick appropriate meme format (Drake, Distracted Boyfriend, etc)"""
        
    def add_text(self, template, top_text, bottom_text):
        """Add text with proper meme grammar (impact font energy)"""
        
    def predict_virality(self, meme):
        """
        Score based on:
        - Relatability: 0-10
        - Timing: 0-10
        - Spiciness: 0-10
        - Cringe factor: -5 to 5 (some cringe is good!)
        """
        
    def optimize_for_platform(self, meme, platform):
        """Adjust for Reddit vs Twitter vs Instagram"""

# Example pipeline:
# News: "Python 4.0 released"
# -> Template: "Drake meme"
# -> Top: "Writing code in Python 3.12"
# -> Bottom: "Waiting for Python 4.0"
# -> Virality: 7/10 (nerds will love it)
```

## Exercise 4: Procrastination Assistant ï¿½ïª†

    def receive_task(self, important_task):
        """
        Receive a task and immediately find ways to avoid it
        Break it down into 'why this can wait until tomorrow'
        """
        
    def generate_excuse(self, task, creativity_level=5):
        """
        Create believable excuses:
        Level 1: "I'm sick"
        Level 5: "I need to research the optimal approach first"
        Level 10: "Mercury is in retrograde"
        """
        
    def suggest_distraction(self):

        - "Clean your desk"
        - "Organize files"
        - "Learn a new programming language"
        - "Watch educational YouTube"
        """
        
    def calculate_panic_time(self, deadline):

        Notice patterns like 'always sad on Mondays'
        """
        
    def identify_triggers(self, conversation):
        """
        Find what topics cause emotional responses:
        - Work mentions -> stress
        - Family -> complicated
        - Exercise -> avoidance
        """
        
    def remember_breakthroughs(self, moment):
        """

    def generate_loot(self, challenge_rating, player_greed_level):
        """

## Submission Instructions
- Submit solutions as separate Python files
- Include example usage for each class/function
- Add comments explaining your approach
- Test with various inputs to show robustness
- Due: Before Week 6 lecture


## Note
Since actual AI API calls may not be available, simulate AI responses where needed. Focus on the structure and logic of your solutions rather than actual AI integration.
