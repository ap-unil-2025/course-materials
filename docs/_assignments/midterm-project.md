## Overview

Build a comprehensive **AI-Powered Personal Finance Tracker** that demonstrates mastery of all concepts from Weeks 1-6. This project **requires continuous git usage** with specific milestones that cannot be completed in one session - each milestone builds upon the previous and introduces new concepts as they are learned in class.

- Use milestones to maintain steady progress
- Ask for help early when stuck

### Technical Approach
- Begin with simple implementations and refactor
- Write tests as you develop, not afterward
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Document your design decisions

### Learning Focus
- This project reinforces every concept from the course
- Use it as an opportunity to solidify understanding
- Don't just implement - understand why each piece works
- Connect course concepts to real-world applications
