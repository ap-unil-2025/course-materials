# First Things First
*   **Welcome!** This is a hands-on tutorial to get you started with essential programming tools for researchers.
*   **Goal:** By the end of this session, you will be comfortable using the terminal, managing Python environments, and using VSCode.
*   **Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of Python and programming concepts. No prior experience with the terminal or Git is required.
* If you haven't done this before, download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) before the session, as well as the Python extension for VSCode. 
*   **Resources:** All slides and code examples are available on the class [GitHub](github.com/ap-unil-2025/ap-unil-2025-meta) repository and the class [website](https://ap-unil-2025.github.io/ap-unil-2025-meta/).

# What is a Terminal, and why do we need it?

*   **Terminal**: A text-based interface to interact with your computer's operating system.

*   **Why use it?**
    *   **Efficiency**: Faster and more flexible than graphical interfaces, especially for repetitive tasks.
    *   **More importantly** — a lot of computers actually don't even come with a graphic interface, like many servers and high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.
*   **The terminal allows you to** do pretty much anything you can do with a graphical user interface (GUI), but often more efficiently.
* A lot of programming tools and libraries are designed to be used from the terminal, so it is essential to know how to use it.
---

# What is a shell? 

*  A shell is a **program** that **reads and executes** what you write in the terminal.

*   Used to execute commands, navigate the file system, and run scripts.

*   Provides an interface between the user and the system.

*  The two most common shells are:
    *   **Bash** (Bourne Again SHell) — the default on many Linux distributions.
    *   **Zsh** (Z Shell) — the default on macOS and increasingly popular on Linux.

# Using the Terminal on Your Personal Computer: MacOS


*   `Terminal.app` is built-in. Look it up in Spotlight (Cmd + Space) or find it in Applications > Utilities.
*   You can also install applications like `iTerm2`, `Ghostty` or `Warp`.
* Install `brew` (Homebrew) to easily install other tools and packages from the terminal.
* Run 
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
* After that, open a new terminal window and run:
    * `brew install git` to install Git.
    * `brew install python3.12` to install Python.
    * `brew install uv` to install `uv`, our new package manager.


---
# Using the Terminal on Your Personal Computer: Windows

*   Use the `Windows Terminal` app (built-in).
* There are a lot of ways to use these commands on Windows, but I recommend using the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**, which allows you to run a Linux distribution alongside Windows. 
* This will give you a more consistent experience with the commands we will be using.
* It takes a while to install, so do it before the next session.

---
# For now: Using a Github Codespace
*   **GitHub Codespaces**: A cloud-based development environment that runs in your browser.
*   Provides a full-featured terminal and code editor without needing to install anything locally.
* Go to [GitHub Codespaces](codespaces.github.com) and create a new codespace.
*   You can use the terminal in the codespace just like you would on your local machine.
*   This is a great way to get started without worrying about local setup issues.
---

# Using the Terminal in VSCode

*   **Built-in Terminal:**
    *   VSCode has a built-in terminal, accessible with `Ctrl+backtick` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+backtick` (macOS).
    *   Supports multiple shell options (e.g., Bash, PowerShell, Zsh).

*   **Why use it?**
    *   **Convenience**: Run commands without leaving the editor.
    *   **Multiple Terminals**: You can open several terminal instances and switch between them (e.g., for different environments).
---

# Useful Shortcuts for the Terminal

*   `Ctrl + L`:
    *   Clears the terminal screen.
*   `Tab`:
    *   Autocompletes file and directory names.
*   `Ctrl + R`:
    *   Searches through your command history.
*   `Ctrl + C`:
    *   Interrupts or stops the current command.
*   `Ctrl + D`:
    *   Logs out or ends input.
---
# Useful Shortcuts
*   `Ctrl + A`:
    *   Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
*   `Ctrl + E`:
    *   Moves the cursor to the end of the line.
*   `Ctrl + U`:
    *   Deletes from the cursor to the start of the line.
*   `Ctrl + K`:
    *   Deletes from the cursor to the end of the line.

---

# Basic Navigation Commands: `cd`, `ls`

*   `pwd` — **P**rint the full path to the **w**orking **d**irectory you are in.
*   `cd <directory>` — **C**hange **d**irectory.
    *   `cd ..` — Move up one directory level.
    *   `cd ~` — Go to the home directory.
*   `ls` — **L**i**s**t directory contents.
    *   `ls -a` — List **a**ll files, including hidden ones (files that start with a dot).
*   Combine options:
    *   `ls -la` — List all files with detailed information.

The parts of the command written with a dash before them are called **flags**. They modify the behavior of the command. For example, most commands have an `-h` flag for help.

---

# Commands: `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, `touch`, `mkdir`

*   `mv <source> <destination>` — **M**o**v**e or rename files.
*   `cp <source> <destination>` — **C**o**p**y files or directories.
*   `rm <file>` — **R**e**m**ove files. **Caution!** This does not put the files in a “trash bin", it removes them **permanently**.
    *   `rm -r <directory>` — Remove a directory and all files within it recursively.
*   `touch <file>` — Create an empty file or update its timestamp.
*   `mkdir <directory>` — **M**a**k**e a new **dir**ectory.
    *   Use `mkdir -p` to create nested directories.

---

# Using the Wildcard Symbol (`*`)

*   **What is the Wildcard Symbol (`*`)?**
    *   The wildcard symbol `*` matches any number of characters in filenames or directories.
    * That is, it is a **placeholder** for any characters.
    *   Useful for performing operations on multiple files at once.
    

*   **Using Wildcards:**
    *   You can use wildcards to match specific file patterns.
    *   Example: `rm *.jpg` — Removes all files with a `.jpg` extension in the current folder.

---

# Commands: `cat`, `head` and `tail`

*   `cat` — Concatenate and display the content of a file:
    *   `cat <file>` — Displays the entire content of a file.
    *   Useful for quickly viewing or concatenating files.

* `head` and  `tail` — Display the first/last few lines of a file:
    *   `tail <file>` — Shows the last 10 lines of a file by default.
    *   `tail -n <number> <file>` — Shows the last `<number>` lines of the file.

*   `tail -f <file>` — Follow a file for real-time updates:
    *   Continuously displays new lines as they are added to a file (useful for monitoring logs).
---
# Commands: `echo`, `clear`, `man`
*   `echo <text>` — Prints text to the terminal.
    *   Example: `echo "Hello, World!"` prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.
*   `clear` — Clears the terminal screen.
*   `man <command>` — Displays the manual page for a command.
    *   Provides detailed information about the command, its options, and usage.
    *   Example: `man ls` shows the manual for the `ls` command.
    *   Use `q` to exit the manual page.

---

# Terminal text editor: `nano`

*   Sometimes you might want to quickly edit a code file without leaving the terminal (i.e., fix some bug before running a job on an HPC cluster).

*   You can use `nano` — a simple command-line text editor. It is available on Linux and MacOS by default.
    *   `nano <file>`

*   Not a lot of features on the first glance, but can be configured to use syntax highlighting and formatting.

*   Compare with more advanced terminal-based editors like `Vim` — not covered in this tutorial, but Anna will be happy to talk about it ;)

---

# What is a Python Installation?

*   **Python Installation:**
    *   The core Python interpreter installed on your system.
    *   On most systems, Python is pre-installed or can be installed via package managers (e.g., `apt`, `brew`).
    *   On Windows, you generally have to install Python from the Python website.
---
# What is a Python (Virtual) Environment?
*   **Python (Virtual) Environment:**
    *   An isolated "space" that includes a specific Python interpreter and its associated packages.
    *   As in, it is a **folder** which contains the Python executable file and the files of installed packages.
    *   Multiple environments allow different projects to use different package versions without conflicts.

---

# Running Python Code in the Terminal

Now we know enough to write and run our first Python script!
*   Create a new file named `hello_world.py` in your project directory.
*   Open it in VSCode or any text editor and add the following code:
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
*   Save the file.
*  Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
*   Run the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python3 hello_world.py
    ```
---
# Difference Between `.ipynb` and `.py` Files

*   **.ipynb Files:**
    *   Stands for "Interactive Python Notebook."
    *   Supports mixing code with rich text, images, and visualizations.
    *   Ideal for drafting, demonstration, data exploration, teaching, and collaboration.
    *   Not typically used in projects as main source code files.

*   **.py Files:**
    *   Standard Python script files, only contain Python codes.
    *   Used for writing production code, modules, and libraries.
    *   Can be executed directly in the terminal or an IDE.
---

# `venv`

*   `venv` is a built-in Python module for creating virtual environments.
*   Ensures that each project has its own set of dependencies --- that is, **external Python libraries at the specific versions you need.**
*   Prevents version conflicts between projects.
*   Does not break the system installation of Python.
*  Used to be optional, but is currently the **standard** way to manage Python environments.
* Your system Python will actually enforce you to use `venv` for any project that has dependencies!
---
# Creating a Virtual Environment with `venv`
*   To create a new virtual environment, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```
*   This creates a new directory named `myenv` in your current directory.
*   The `myenv` directory contains a copy of the Python interpreter and a `bin` directory with the `python` and `pip` programs.
*   **Important!** The name `myenv` is just an example. You can name your environment anything you like, but it is a good practice to use a descriptive name that reflects the project it is associated with.
---

# Command: `which`

*   `which <command>` — Shows the full path of the command or executable.

*   Helps identify where an executable is located.

*   **Example: `which python3`**
    *   Output: `/usr/bin/python3`, tells you the system is using Python from this location.
    *   If you run this after activating a venv, the output will be `.../myenv/bin/python3`.

*   Useful for debugging, e.g., ensuring that you're using the right version of Python in the terminal.

---

# Installing Packages: `pip`

*   A **package manager** is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software packages.
*   It helps manage dependencies, ensuring that the correct versions of libraries or software are available for your project.
*   `pip` is the default package manager for Python.
*   Like `python` and `venv`, `pip` is a command you run from your terminal.

**Caution!** Make sure you are installing packages in the correct **virtual environment** (your prompt should show `(myenv)` when it is activated).

---


# Installing Packages: `pip`

*   **Common usage of `pip`:**
    *   `pip install <package>` — Install a package from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
    *   `pip install -r requirements.txt` — Install all packages listed in a requirements file.
        *   A requirements file contains all package versions your project depends on.
        *   This is **crucial** for reproducibility and collaboration!
---
# Installing Packages: `pip`
*   **Managing dependencies:**
    *   `pip freeze > requirements.txt` — Save the current environment's packages to a file.
    *   `pip list` — List all installed packages.

*   **Uninstalling packages:**
    *   `pip uninstall <package>` — Remove a package.

---
# Advanced Package Management: `uv`
*   **`uv`**: A tool for managing Python environments and packages, similar to `pip`, but with a rich set of features and impressive performance.
*   **Why use `uv`?**
    *   Provides a more user-friendly interface for managing Python environments and Python versions.
    *   Much faster than `pip` for installing packages. 
    *   Supports creating and managing virtual environments with ease.
    *   We will **use it in our class** and cover it in more detail in the next sessions. `uv` includes `venv` and `pip` functionality, so you will not get lost.
