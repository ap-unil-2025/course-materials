# First Things First
*   **Welcome!** This is a hands-on tutorial to get you started with essential programming tools for researchers.
*   **Goal:** By the end of this session, you will be comfortable using the terminal, managing Python environments, and using VSCode.
*   **Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of Python and programming concepts. No prior experience with the terminal or Git is required.
*   **Resources:** All slides and code examples are available on the class [GitHub](github.com/ap-unil-2025/ap-unil-2025-meta) repository and the class [website](https://ap-unil-2025.github.io/ap-unil-2025-meta/).

# Please open the following page in your browser!
Nuvolos: https://nuvolos.com/
Launch your workspace for this course (you should have received an email with the link).
Log in with your university credentials
Open the terminal in your workspace (bottom panel in VSCode).

---
# What is a Terminal, and why do we need it?

*   **Terminal**: A text-based interface to interact with your computer's operating system.

*   **Why use it?**
    *   **Efficiency**: Faster and more flexible than graphical interfaces, especially for repetitive tasks.
    *   **More importantly** — a lot of computers actually don't even come with a graphic interface, like many servers and high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.
*   **The terminal allows you to** do pretty much anything you can do with a graphical user interface (GUI), but often more efficiently.
* A lot of programming tools and libraries are designed to be used from the terminal, so it is essential to know how to use it.
---

# What is a shell? 

*  A shell is a **program** that **reads and executes** what you write in the terminal.

*   Used to execute commands, navigate the file system, and run scripts.

*   Provides an interface between the user and the system.

*  The two most common shells are:
    *   **Bash** (Bourne Again SHell) — the default on many Linux distributions.
    *   **Zsh** (Z Shell) — the default on macOS and increasingly popular on Linux.

<!-- ![bg right:70% 90%](https://techterms.com/img/xl/terminal_610.png) -->

<!-- --- --> 

<!-- # Using the Terminal on Your Personal Computer: MacOS


*   `Terminal.app` is built-in. Look it up in Spotlight (Cmd + Space) or find it in Applications > Utilities.
*   You can also install applications like `iTerm2`, `Ghostty` or `Warp`.
* Install `brew` (Homebrew) to easily install other tools and packages from the terminal.
* Run 
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
* After that, open a new terminal window and run:
    * `brew install git` to install Git.
    * `brew install python3.12` to install Python.
    * `brew install uv` to install `uv`, our new package manager. -->

<!-- 
---
# Using the Terminal on Your Personal Computer: Windows

*   Use the `Windows Terminal` app (built-in).
* There are a lot of ways to use these commands on Windows, but I recommend using the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**, which allows you to run a Linux distribution alongside Windows. 
* This will give you a more consistent experience with the commands we will be using.
* It takes a while to install, so do it before the next session. -->

---

# Using the Terminal in VSCode

*   **Built-in Terminal:**
    *   VSCode has a built-in terminal, accessible with `Ctrl+backtick` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+backtick` (macOS).
    *   Supports multiple shell options (e.g., Bash, PowerShell, Zsh).

*   **Why use it?**
    *   **Convenience**: Run commands without leaving the editor.
    *   **Multiple Terminals**: You can open several terminal instances and switch between them (e.g., for different environments).
---
# Your first commands in the terminal
*   Open the terminal in your Nuvolos workspace.
*   Type the following command and press Enter:
```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
---
# Bash is a Programming Language
*   Bash is a command language and a scripting language.
*   You can control the behavior of your computer by writing commands in Bash.
*   You can run commands one by one in the terminal, just like we did with `echo "Hello, World!"`.
*   You can write scripts (files with a series of commands) to automate tasks
---
# Bash is a Programming Language
*   Create a new file named `myscript.sh` and add the following content:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is my first script!"
ls -la
```
*   Save the file and make it executable with:
```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
```
*   Run the script with:
```bash
./myscript.sh
```
---
# Bash is a Programming Language
*   Bash supports variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
*   Example of a simple bash script with a loop:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir my_test_folder
cd my_test_folder
pwd
for i in {1..5}
do
   touch "file_$i.txt"
   echo "Created file_$i.txt"
done
```
*   Save it as `loop.sh`, make it executable, and run it to see the output.
---

# Basic Navigation Commands: `cd`, `ls`

*   `pwd` — **P**rint the full path to the **w**orking **d**irectory you are in.
*   `cd <directory>` — **C**hange **d**irectory.
    *   `cd ..` — Move up one directory level.
    *   `cd ~` — Go to the home directory.
*   `ls` — **L**i**s**t directory contents.
    *   `ls -a` — List **a**ll files, including hidden ones (files that start with a dot).
*   Combine options:
    *   `ls -la` — List all files with detailed information.

The parts of the command written with a dash before them are called **flags**. They modify the behavior of the command. For example, most commands have an `-h` flag for help.

---

# Commands: `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, `touch`, `mkdir`

*   `mv <source> <destination>` — **M**o**v**e or rename files.
*   `cp <source> <destination>` — **C**o**p**y files or directories.
*   `rm <file>` — **R**e**m**ove files. **Caution!** This does not put the files in a “trash bin", it removes them **permanently**.
    *   `rm -r <directory>` — Remove a directory and all files within it recursively.
*   `touch <file>` — Create an empty file or update its timestamp.
*   `mkdir <directory>` — **M**a**k**e a new **dir**ectory.
    *   Use `mkdir -p` to create nested directories.

---

# Using the Wildcard Symbol (`*`)

*   **What is the Wildcard Symbol (`*`)?**
    *   The wildcard symbol `*` matches any number of characters in filenames or directories.
    * That is, it is a **placeholder** for any characters.
    *   Useful for performing operations on multiple files at once.
    

*   **Using Wildcards:**
    *   You can use wildcards to match specific file patterns.
    *   Example: `rm *.jpg` — Removes all files with a `.jpg` extension in the current folder.

---

# Commands: `cat`, `head` and `tail`

*   `cat` — Concatenate and display the content of a file:
    *   `cat <file>` — Displays the entire content of a file.
    *   Useful for quickly viewing or concatenating files.

* `head` and  `tail` — Display the first/last few lines of a file:
    *   `tail <file>` — Shows the last 10 lines of a file by default.
    *   `tail -n <number> <file>` — Shows the last `<number>` lines of the file.

*   `tail -f <file>` — Follow a file for real-time updates:
    *   Continuously displays new lines as they are added to a file (useful for monitoring logs).
---
# Commands: `echo`, `clear`, `man`
*   `echo <text>` — Prints text to the terminal.
    *   Example: `echo "Hello, World!"` prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.
*   `clear` — Clears the terminal screen.
*   `man <command>` — Displays the manual page for a command.
    *   Provides detailed information about the command, its options, and usage.
    *   Example: `man ls` shows the manual for the `ls` command.
    *   Use `q` to exit the manual page.
---
# Useful Shortcuts for the Terminal

*   `Ctrl + L`:
    *   Clears the terminal screen.
*   `Tab`:
    *   Autocompletes file and directory names.
*   `Ctrl + R`:
    *   Searches through your command history.
*   `Ctrl + C`:
    *   Interrupts or stops the current command.
*   `Ctrl + D`:
    *   Logs out or ends input.
---
# Useful Shortcuts
*   `Ctrl + A`:
    *   Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
*   `Ctrl + E`:
    *   Moves the cursor to the end of the line.
*   `Ctrl + U`:
    *   Deletes from the cursor to the start of the line.
*   `Ctrl + K`:
    *   Deletes from the cursor to the end of the line.
---
# Advanced Terminal Features: Redirection, Pipes, and More
# (Optional)
---
# Redirection and Output to Files: `>`, `>>`
*   `>` — Redirects the output of a command to a file, overwriting the file if it exists.
    *   Example: `echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt` — Creates (or overwrites) `hello.txt` with "Hello, World!".
*   `>>` — Appends the output of a command to a file, creating the file if it doesn't exist.
    *   Example: `echo "Another line" >> hello.txt` — Appends "Another line" to `hello.txt`.
*   These operators are useful for saving command output for later use or logging.
---
# Search with `grep`
*   `grep <pattern> <file>` — Searches for a specific pattern in a file.
    *   Example: `grep "error" log.txt` — Finds all lines containing "error" in `log.txt`.
*   `grep -i <pattern> <file>` — Case-insensitive search.
*   `grep -r <pattern> <directory>` — Recursively search through all files in a directory.
*   `grep -n <pattern> <file>` — Show line numbers of matching lines.
*   `grep` is a powerful tool for searching through text files and logs.        

---
# Combining Commands with `&&` and `;`
*   `&&` — Logical AND operator:
    *   Executes the second command only if the first command is successful (returns exit status 0).
    *   Example: `mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder` — Creates a new folder and changes into it only if the folder creation was successful.
*   `;` — Command separator:
    *   Executes the second command regardless of the success or failure of the first command.
    *   Example: `mkdir new_folder; cd new_folder` — Creates a new folder and changes into it, regardless of whether the folder creation was successful or not.

---
# Pipelines with `|`
*   The pipe symbol `|` takes the output of one command and uses it as the input for another command.
*   Example: `ls -l | grep ".txt"` — Lists all files in long format and filters the output to show only `.txt` files.
*   You can chain multiple commands together using pipes.
*   Example: `cat file.txt | grep "error" | sort | uniq` — Finds lines containing "error" in `file.txt`, sorts them, and removes duplicates.
---
# Useful Programs: `nano`, `vim`, `htop`
*   `nano <file>` — A simple terminal-based text editor.
    *   Easy to use for beginners. Use `Ctrl + X` to exit, `Y` to save changes.
*   `vim <file>` — A powerful terminal-based text editor.
    *   More complex, but very efficient once mastered. Use `:q` to quit, `:w` to save changes.
*   `htop` — An interactive process viewer.
    *   Displays system processes and resource usage in real-time. Use `F10` to exit.
*   These programs are installed in your Nuvolos workspace by default.
---
# Advanced Terminal Features: Tab Completion and Command History
*   **Tab Completion:**
    *   Press the `Tab` key while typing a command or filename to auto-complete it.
    *   If multiple options are available, press `Tab` twice to see a list of possible completions.
*   **Command History:**
    *   Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to navigate through your command history.
    *   Press `Ctrl + R` to search through your command history. Start typing a part of a previous command, and it will show matching commands.
*   These features can significantly speed up your workflow in the terminal.
---
# Advanced Terminal Programs: `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`
*   `ssh` — **S**ecure **SH**ell, used to securely connect to a remote machine over a network.
*   `ssh <user>@<host>` — Securely connect to a remote machine.
    *   Example: `ssh user@192.168.1.1`
*   `scp <local_file> <user>@<host>:<remote_path>` — Securely copy files to/from a remote machine.
    *   Example: `scp file.txt user@192.168.1.1:/remote/directory/`
*   `rsync` — A fast and versatile file-copying tool.
    *   Can copy files locally or to/from a remote machine.
    *   Example: `rsync -avz file.txt user@192.168.1.1:/remote/directory/`
*   `rsync` is more efficient than `scp` for large files or directories, as it only transfers the differences between source and destination.
---
# Python Environments and Package Management
---
# What is a Python Installation?
 *   The core Python interpreter installed on your system.
        * A Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code.
*   On most systems, Python is pre-installed or can be installed via package managers (e.g., `apt`, `brew`).
*   On Windows, you generally have to install Python from the Python website.
* On Nuvolos, you don't have to care about this, as Python is already installed in your workspace.
---
# What is a Python (Virtual) Environment?
*   An isolated "space" that includes a specific Python interpreter and its associated packages.
*   Allows you to manage dependencies for different projects without conflicts.
*   As in, it is a **folder** which contains the Python executable file and the files of installed packages.
*   Multiple environments allow different projects to use different package versions without conflicts.

---

# Running Python Code in the Terminal

Now we know enough to write and run our first Python script!
*   Create a new file named `hello_world.py` in your project directory.
*   Open it in VSCode and add the following code:
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
*   Save the file.
*  Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
*   Run the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python3 hello_world.py
    ```
---
# Difference Between `.ipynb` and `.py` Files

*   **.ipynb Files:**
    *   Stands for "Interactive Python Notebook."
    *   Supports mixing code with rich text, images, and visualizations.
    *   Ideal for drafting, demonstration, data exploration, teaching, and collaboration.
    *   Not typically used in projects as main source code files.

*   **.py Files:**
    *   Standard Python script files, only contain Python codes.
    *   Used for writing production code, modules, and libraries.
    *   Can be executed directly in the terminal or an IDE.
---

# `venv`

*   `venv` is a built-in Python module for creating virtual environments.
*   Ensures that each project has its own set of dependencies --- that is, **external Python libraries at the specific versions you need.**
*   Prevents version conflicts between projects.
*   Does not break the system installation of Python.
*  Used to be optional, but is currently the **standard** way to manage Python environments.
* Your system Python will actually enforce you to use `venv` for any project that has dependencies!
---
# Creating a Virtual Environment with `venv`
*   To create a new virtual environment, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```
*   This creates a new directory named `myenv` in your current directory.
*   The `myenv` directory contains a copy of the Python interpreter and a `bin` directory with the `python` and `pip` programs.
*   **Important!** The name `myenv` is just an example. You can name your environment anything you like, but it is a good practice to use a descriptive name that reflects the project it is associated with.
---

# Command: `which`

*   `which <command>` — Shows the full path of the command or executable.

*   Helps identify where an executable is located.

*   **Example: `which python3`**
    *   Output: `/usr/bin/python3`, tells you the system is using Python from this location.
    *   If you run this after activating a venv, the output will be `.../myenv/bin/python3`.

*   Useful for debugging, e.g., ensuring that you're using the right version of Python in the terminal.

---

# Installing Packages: `pip`

* A **software package** is a collection of files and metadata that provide specific functionality or features, such as libraries or frameworks.
    * They are simply code that someone else wrote, which you can use in your own code.
*   A **package manager** is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software packages.
    *   It helps manage dependencies, ensuring that the correct versions of libraries or software are available for your project.
*   `pip` is the default package manager for Python.
*   Like `python` and `venv`, `pip` is a command you run from your terminal.

---


# Installing Packages: `pip`
> **Caution!** Make sure you are installing packages in the correct **virtual environment** (your prompt should show `(myenv)` when it is activated).
*   `pip install <package>` — Install a package from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
*   `pip install -r requirements.txt` — Install all packages listed in a text file (commonly named `requirements.txt`).
        *   A requirements file contains all package versions your project depends on.
        *   This is **crucial** for reproducibility and collaboration!

---
# Installing Packages: `pip`
*   `pip freeze > requirements.txt` — Save the current environment's packages to a file. Will be covered in more detail in the next sessions as it is CRUCIAL for reproducibility.
*   `pip list` — List all installed packages in your current environment.
*   `pip install --upgrade <package>` — Upgrade a package to the latest version
*   `pip uninstall <package>` — Remove a package.

---
# Advanced Package Management: `uv`
*   **`uv`**: A tool for managing Python environments and packages, similar to `pip`, but with a rich set of features and impressive performance.
*   **Why use `uv`?**
    *   Provides a more user-friendly interface for managing Python environments and Python versions.
    *   Much faster than `pip` for installing packages. 
    *   Supports creating and managing virtual environments with ease.
    *   We will **use it in our class** and cover it in more detail in the next sessions. `uv` includes `venv` and `pip` functionality, so you will not get lost.
---
# Summary
*   The terminal is a powerful tool for interacting with your computer and running commands efficiently.
*   Basic commands like `cd`, `ls`, `mv`, `cp`, and `rm` help you navigate and manage files and directories.
*   Python virtual environments (`venv`) are essential for managing project dependencies and avoiding conflicts.
*   `pip` is the default package manager for Python, while `uv` is a more advanced tool that we will be using in this class.
*   Using these tools effectively will enhance your productivity and help you manage your coding projects like a pro!
