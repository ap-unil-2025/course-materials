# Capstone Project Guidelines
**Data Science and Advanced Programming @ UNIL 2025**

## Overview
The capstone project is an **individual** data science project that demonstrates your mastery of the concepts and tools learned throughout the course. This project constitutes **100% of your final grade**.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-5**: Explore potential project topics
- **Week 6**: **Project proposal deadline** - Submit your topic selection
- **Week 7-13**: Work on your project independently
- **Week 14 (Dec 15)**: Final submission and voluntary presentations

## Project Requirements

### 1. Project Scope
Your project should:
- Address a real-world problem in economics, finance, or a related field
- Involve substantial data analysis and/or modeling
- Demonstrate proficiency in Python programming
- Show understanding of statistical learning concepts covered in the course

### 2. Deliverables

#### A. Project Report (10 pages)
Your report should include:
- **Introduction** (1 page): Problem statement and motivation
- **Data Description** (1-2 pages): Sources, preprocessing, exploratory analysis
- **Methodology** (2-3 pages): Models/techniques used and justification
- **Results** (2-3 pages): Findings with visualizations
- **Discussion** (1-2 pages): Interpretation, limitations, future work
- **Conclusion** (0.5 page): Summary of key findings
- **References** (0.5 page): Properly cited sources

#### B. GitHub Repository
Your repository must contain:
- All code files (`.py` or `.ipynb`)
- Data files (or instructions to obtain them if too large)
- `README.md` with:
  - Project description
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage guide
  - Dependencies list
- Clear documentation and comments
- **No strict engineering requirements** (no mypy/type checking required)

#### C. Video Presentation (10 minutes maximum)
- Clear explanation of your project
- Demonstration of key results
- Discussion of challenges and learnings
- Can be screen recording with narration

## Project Ideas

### Economics/Finance Focus

## Homework Bonus Points
While the project is 100% of your grade, completing weekly homework assignments can earn bonus points that will:
- Boost your final grade by up to 10%
- Provide practice for project work
- Offer feedback on your progress

## Tips for Success

### Start Early
- Begin exploring datasets and topics in Week 1
- Don't wait until Week 6 to choose your topic
- Allocate time for unexpected challenges

### Choose Wisely
- Pick a topic you're genuinely interested in
- Ensure data availability before committing
- Consider your background and strengths

### Keep It Simple
- Better to do something simple well than complex poorly
- Focus on clear implementation over advanced features
- Prioritize working code over perfect code

### Document Everything
- Keep notes of your process
- Comment your code as you write it
- Create visualizations to support your findings

### Use Course Resources
- Apply techniques from lectures
- Leverage TA office hours
- Review provided examples and materials

## Submission Instructions

### Week 6: Project Proposal
Submit a 1-page document containing:
- Project title
- Problem description
- Data source(s)
- Proposed methodology
- Expected outcomes

### Week 14: Final Submission
1. **GitHub Repository**: Share repository link
2. **Report**: Submit PDF via course platform
3. **Video**: Upload to platform or provide link
4. **Presentation Sign-up**: Optional for in-class presentation

## Academic Integrity
- This is an **individual** project
- You may discuss ideas with classmates but all code and writing must be your own
- Properly cite all sources and references
- Use of AI tools (like GitHub Copilot) is allowed but must be acknowledged

## Support Resources
- **TA Office Hours**: Mondays 15:15-16:00 with Anna Smirnova
- **Individual Sessions**: Fridays by appointment
- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions and peer support
- **Nuvolos Platform**: For computing resources

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use external libraries not covered in class?**
A: Yes, but make sure to explain why and how you use them.

**Q: What if my data is proprietary?**
A: Use synthetic or anonymized data for submission, explain limitations in report.

**Q: Can I extend a project from another course?**
A: Only if you add substantial new analysis using techniques from this course.

**Q: Is group work allowed?**
A: No, this must be individual work. Collaboration on ideas is fine, but implementation must be independent.

**Q: What if I can't present in Week 14?**
A: Video submission is mandatory; in-class presentation is optional.
