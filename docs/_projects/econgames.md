## Overview

Develop a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation toolkit for analyzing game-theoretic scenarios in economics. Focus on strategic interactions, equilibrium finding, and evolutionary dynamics.

## What You'll Build

A sophisticated game theory toolkit that:
- Simulates multi-player strategic games
- Finds Nash equilibria using computational methods
- Analyzes evolutionary stable strategies
- Models network effects in economic interactions

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Game Theory**: Implement fundamental and advanced game-theoretic concepts
- **Algorithm Design**: Develop efficient equilibrium-finding algorithms
- **Network Analysis**: Model strategic interactions on graphs
- **Economic Modeling**: Apply computational methods to economic problems

## Core Features to Implement

### Game Types
- Normal form games (matrix games)
- Extensive form games (sequential)
- Evolutionary games with population dynamics
- Network games with spatial interactions

### Analysis Tools
- Nash equilibrium computation
- Evolutionary stable strategy analysis
- Monte Carlo strategy evolution
- Convergence and stability testing

### Simulation Engine
- Multi-agent strategy learning
- Population dynamics modeling
- Network topology effects
- Stochastic perturbation analysis

## Technical Challenges

- **Algorithm Complexity**: Efficient equilibrium finding in large games
- **Network Scalability**: Handle large-scale network games
- **Convergence Analysis**: Detect and verify equilibrium convergence
- **Visualization**: Clear representation of complex strategic interactions

## Domain Knowledge Required

- Basic game theory concepts (Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies)
- Graph theory and network analysis
- Evolutionary dynamics principles
- Economic intuition helpful but not required

## Assessment Focus

- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Correct implementation of game-theoretic algorithms
