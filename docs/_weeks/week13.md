## Week 13: High-Performance Computing with Python

### Topics Covered
- Python for Scientific Computing - the general idea
- Numba: JIT compiler for fast machine code
- Parallelization and multi-threading
- Multi-threading techniques (if time permits)
- JAX and Flax (self-study)

### Practical Implementation
This week focuses on hands-on implementation of HPC concepts introduced in Week 12, with practical examples of accelerating Python code for scientific computing applications.
