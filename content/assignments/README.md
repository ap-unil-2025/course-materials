## Cohesive Project: Contact Manager

Weeks 3, 4, and 6 build upon each other with a Contact Manager project:

- **Week 3**: Basic implementation with variables and control flow (v0.1)
- **Week 4**: Upgrade with functions and data structures (v1.0)
- **Week 5**: Demo showing AI can recreate it instantly
- **Week 6**: Professional OOP implementation with debugging (v2.0)

## GitHub Classroom

All assignments are distributed and submitted via GitHub Classroom:

1. Students accept assignment links
2. Personal repositories are created automatically
3. Starter code and tests are provided
4. Automated testing provides immediate feedback
5. Instructors can review and grade directly on GitHub

See `github-classroom-setup.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Learning Philosophy

These assignments follow a practice-driven approach:

1. **Hands-on Learning**: Every assignment requires actual coding
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Skills build week by week
3. **Real-world Applications**: Projects simulate actual development scenarios
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Automated testing provides instant validation
5. **Creative Freedom**: Advanced assignments encourage exploration

## Support Resources

- **Office Hours**: Wednesdays 2-4 PM
- **GitHub Discussions**: Each assignment repo has discussions enabled
- **Course Discord**: Real-time help from TAs and peers
- **Example Solutions**: Released one week after due date

## Academic Integrity

- All code must be original work
- Collaboration is allowed on concepts, not code
- AI tools may be used as specified in each assignment
- Plagiarism detection is automated
- Violations result in zero points

## Tips for Success

### For Regular Assignments
1. Start early - don't wait until the deadline
2. Read all instructions carefully
3. Run tests frequently
4. Commit code often
5. Ask questions when stuck

### For Advanced Assignments
1. These are meant to be challenging
2. Plan before coding
3. Break problems into smaller parts
4. Document your approach
5. Learn from the struggle
