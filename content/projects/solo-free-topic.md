## Overview

Propose and implement your own software engineering project on any topic **except data science**. This option allows maximum creativity while maintaining all technical requirements of the course.

## What You Can Build

Any software engineering project that:
- Solves a real problem or addresses an interesting challenge
- Demonstrates advanced programming concepts
- Is **NOT** primarily focused on data analysis or machine learning
- Shows creativity and technical innovation

## Project Examples (Inspiration Only)

### Allowed Topics
- **Developer Tools**: Build IDEs, debuggers, or development utilities
- **Games & Entertainment**: Create games, interactive applications, or media tools
- **System Software**: Develop compilers, interpreters, or system utilities  
- **Web Applications**: Build full-stack applications with complex functionality
- **Mobile Apps**: Create native or cross-platform mobile applications
- **CLI Tools**: Develop professional command-line utilities
- **APIs & Services**: Design and implement web services or microservices
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Implement novel algorithms or optimization tools

### Forbidden Topics
- **Data Science Projects**: Primary focus on datasets, ML models, or statistical analysis
- **Simple CRUD Applications**: Basic database-driven apps without complexity
- **Tutorial Follow-alongs**: Projects that merely implement existing tutorials
- **Academic Assignments**: Rehashing previous coursework

## Proposal Requirements

Submit a **one-paragraph proposal** including:
- **Problem Statement**: What challenge does your project address?
- **Technical Approach**: High-level architecture and main technologies
- **Innovation Factor**: What makes your project interesting or unique?
- **Complexity Justification**: Why this meets advanced programming standards

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Independent Problem-Solving**: Define and tackle your own challenges
- **Technical Innovation**: Explore cutting-edge technologies or approaches
- **Project Management**: Handle full project lifecycle independently
- **Creative Engineering**: Balance creativity with technical rigor

## Assessment Focus

- **Technical Complexity**: Demonstrates advanced programming concepts
- **Innovation**: Shows creativity and original thinking
- **Code Quality**: Meets all course standards for testing, documentation, etc.
- **Problem-Solving**: Addresses a real challenge effectively

## Proposal Process

1. **Brainstorm Ideas**: Consider problems you're passionate about solving
2. **Research Feasibility**: Ensure your idea is technically achievable
3. **Write Proposal**: One paragraph covering all required elements
4. **Submit for Approval**: Upload to Moodle by **Week 2 Friday 23:59 CET**
5. **Await Feedback**: Anna will approve or request modifications

## Support & Resources

- **Proposal Review**: Get feedback before submission in office hours
- **Technical Guidance**: Regular check-ins during development
- **Flexibility**: Adjust scope as needed during implementation
- **Documentation**: Extra emphasis on explaining your creative choices

## Technical Requirements

**Same as team projects:**
- Python 3.10+, full CI/CD pipeline
- â‰¥90% test coverage, comprehensive documentation
- Professional package structure and deployment
- All quality gates must pass

## Timeline Considerations

- **Week 2**: Proposal submission and approval
- **Weeks 3-8**: Independent development with regular check-ins  
- **Week 8**: Code freeze and v1.0.0 tag
- **Week 9**: Technical report and demo
