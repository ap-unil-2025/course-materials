## Overview

Develop a sophisticated longevity-bond pricing engine that models mortality risk and prices longevity-linked securities. This project combines actuarial science with advanced financial mathematics.

## What You'll Build

A comprehensive pricing engine that:
- Models mortality rates and longevity trends
- Prices longevity bonds and derivatives
- Implements stochastic mortality models
- Provides risk analysis and scenario testing

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Mortality Modeling**: Understand demographic and actuarial concepts
- **Financial Mathematics**: Apply advanced pricing methodologies
- **Stochastic Processes**: Implement time-series models for mortality
- **Risk Management**: Quantify and analyze longevity risk

## Core Features to Implement

### Mortality Models
- Lee-Carter mortality model
- Cairns-Blake-Dowd model extensions
- Stochastic mortality projections
- Cohort effect modeling

### Pricing Engine
- Longevity bond valuation
- Survivor swap pricing
- Mortality derivative instruments
- Risk-neutral measure calibration

### Analysis Tools
- Scenario analysis and stress testing
- Sensitivity analysis to model parameters
- Risk metrics and hedging strategies
- Visualization of mortality surfaces

## Technical Challenges

- **Model Calibration**: Fit complex stochastic models to historical data
- **Numerical Methods**: Implement advanced mathematical algorithms
- **Data Quality**: Handle incomplete and noisy mortality data
- **Performance**: Optimize computationally intensive calculations

## Domain Knowledge Required

- Basic understanding of mortality and life tables
- Financial mathematics and bond pricing concepts
- Stochastic processes and time series analysis
- Statistical modeling experience helpful

## Assessment Focus

- **Mathematical Rigor**: Correct implementation of complex models
- **Model Validation**: Proper testing against known results
- **Innovation**: Creative approaches to longevity modeling
- **Practical Application**: Tools useful for practitioners

## Getting Started

1. **Study mortality modeling** fundamentals and literature
2. **Review longevity bond** structures and market examples
3. **Explore the template** for mathematical framework
4. **Understand demographic** data sources and formats

## Resources

- Actuarial science textbooks on mortality
- Academic papers on longevity bond pricing
- Mortality databases (HMD, HFD)
- Financial mathematics references
