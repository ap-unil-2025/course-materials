## Overview

Build a professional-grade Monte Carlo simulation toolkit for analyzing game-theoretic scenarios in economics. Implement strategies like Tit-for-Tat and Grim Trigger for repeated games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma.

## What You'll Build

A pip-installable Python package with CLI that:
- Simulates repeated 2-player normal-form games
- Implements multiple classic strategies
- Performs statistical analysis of outcomes
- Provides insights into cooperation vs. competition dynamics

## Key Skills Developed

- **Software Engineering**: Strict type checking, 90% test coverage, CI/CD pipeline
- **Game Theory**: Nash equilibria, strategic interactions, evolutionary dynamics
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, Monte Carlo methods, convergence analysis
- **Professional Tools**: MyPy, Ruff, pytest, pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions

## Why This Project?

Game theory underlies many economic phenomena from price wars to environmental cooperation. This project gives you hands-on experience building research-grade simulation tools while enforcing professional software engineering standards.

## Difficulty Level

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Advanced**

This is one of the most challenging projects, requiring:
- Strong Python skills
- Mathematical understanding
- Rigorous testing discipline
- Statistical analysis capabilities

## Getting Started

1. Use the template repository to create your own project
2. Review the comprehensive project brief for detailed requirements
3. Set up your development environment with `make install-dev`
4. Start with the Week 2 milestone: Random vs Random simulation
